# Synth Waveforms Under the Python Microscope

(Placeholder: Introduction - why this is interesting, what synths I'm using)

## Capturing Audio

(Placeholder: How I record the audio from the synths)

## Python Libraries Used

*   `numpy` for numerical operations
*   `scipy` for signal processing (e.g., FFT)
*   `matplotlib` or `plotly` for plotting

## The Process

1.  Load audio file.
2.  Select a small segment of a sustained note.
3.  Perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to see frequency components.
4.  Plot the waveform and its spectrum.

(Placeholder: Code snippets, example plots, analysis of different waveforms like sine, square, saw, pulse)

## What I've Learned

(Placeholder: Insights gained from seeing the waveforms visually)
