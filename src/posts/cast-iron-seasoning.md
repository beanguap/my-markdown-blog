## My Routine

1.  Clean after use (hot water, scraper, sometimes a tiny bit of soap).
2.  Dry THOROUGHLY (stovetop on low heat).
3.  Apply a very thin layer of oil (e.g., grapeseed, canola, or specialized cast iron oil).
4.  Wipe off excess oil â€“ it should look dry.
5.  Heat on stovetop or in oven until it just starts to smoke, then cool.
