# Project: Audio Spectrum Analyzer

This post documents the journey of building my own audio spectrum analyzer.

## The Idea

(Placeholder: Why I wanted to build this, what I aimed to achieve)

## Hardware Components

*   Arduino Nano/Uno
*   MSGEQ7 Spectrum Analyzer IC
*   Electret Microphone Amplifier (e.g., MAX9814)
*   LED Matrix or other display
*   (Full BOM to be listed)

## Software & Code

*   Arduino code for reading MSGEQ7 and interfacing.
*   Python script for processing data and visualization (if applicable).
